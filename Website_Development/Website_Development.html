                <h5 style="text-align: left; text-decoration: underline;">Where We Started:</h5>
                <p style="text-indent: 5%;">After our first conversation over the notebook we had a few options in mind. The first was a traditional notebook; we decided against this due to wanting something easier to colaborate on as well as wanting something that was easier to edit. The second option presented was an electronic notebook and while we thought this was superior to a traditional notebook we ended up going with a website because of the challenge and potential payoff it presented.</p>
                <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">Learning HTML:</h5>
                <p style="text-indent: 5%;">I, Raymond, got straight to work after that meeting due to the fact that I had a prior knowlege of HTML. After looking at different options with my mentor I decided to use bootstrap in order to make a better looking site. With that decicion I started learing bootstrap using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_get_started.asp" style="color: #01ac01; text-decoration: underline;">this</a> tutorial by W3 Schools. We also decided that I should not be the only one able to understand the website so we started the process of teaching my teammate, Evan, HTML so he can suggest edits through GitHub and colaborate with me.</p>
                <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">Using GitHub:</h5>
                <p style="text-indent: 5%;">Though I had prior knowlege of HTML I did not have the experience of hosting a website. There were many options to choose from, however we settled on GitPages to host the website because it would allow us to edit the code from anywhere, collaborate more easily, and it was a free option to host on. So I made a new GitHub account and opened a repository through Visual Code Studio, which has GitHub interation, and uploaded my code. After which I setup a page with that code.</p>
