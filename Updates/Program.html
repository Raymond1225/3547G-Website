          <h3>Program Updates</h3>
          <h5>General Changes</h5>
          <p style="color: #01ac01; text-indent: 5%;">The code has gone through many changes since our last update. Firstly, we had to ditch the vision sensor. We just could not get it working let alone consistently. Second, during one of my many sessions of trial and error for auton I installed a button onto our robot’s claw that allows it to detect a goal and then snap shut. </p>
          <h5>Auton</h5>
          <p style="color: #01ac01; text-indent: 5%;">As for the autons/skills they have improved substantially. We originally just took a neutral goal into our home zone for auton but this was improved to also clear the AWP line grabbing both goals with the claw as I initially found the tail too finicky and slow to work with, however out new auton has use racing backward and grabbing the neutral goal with our tail. We then place rings on the alliance goal using our claw which we outfitted with a ziptie that is threaded through the rings and then through the bottom plate of the claw to create a hold that is strong enough to keep the rings from falling out due to joseling but can be released if we place them on a goal and back up. After doing so our robot then moves backward and then forward again to grab the goal and then ends by moving backward one last time to clear the AWP line.</p>
          <h5>Program Skills</h5>
              <p style="text-indent: 5%;">My first skills auton attempted to push five goals to score 100 points, when I created this I didn’t have access to rings to test how they would interrupt the robot as such I threw caution to the wind. Note, that this was a very bad idea, when we got to competition the next day I tried to run the skills to see if we needed any small adjustments and it would have needed large ones in order to function. After that competition we made some huge changes to the robot, which are documented elsewhere, and I needed to make a new skills to match. I decided on a goal of 40 points and made a code that pushed two neutral goals into the opposite zone than the one I start in.</p>
